# API URL for the backend
# For local development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For CapRover deployment, set this to your backend app URL
# Example: VITE_API_URL=https://jbin-backend.your-domain.com

# NOTE: Analytics (Umami) and reCAPTCHA are now configured on the backend
# and served via /api/config endpoint. No VITE_* variables needed for these.
# See backend/.env.example for configuration options.
